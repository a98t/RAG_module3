    "This notebook demonstrates a simple implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. The goal is to build a question-answering system that leverages a vector database to provide context-aware answers from a Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves:\n",
    "1.  **Data Preparation**: Creating a small, factual dataset of scientific notes.\n",
    "2.  **Environment Setup**: Preparing the Docker environment and installing dependencies.\n",
    "3.  **Database Deployment**: Launching a Weaviate vector database instance using Docker.\n",
    "4.  **Embeddings & Ingestion**: Generating vector embeddings for our data using Azure OpenAI and loading it into Weaviate.\n",
    "5.  **RAG Experiment**: Executing a RAG pipeline:\n",
    "    - Expanding a user's question.\n",
    "    - Searching for relevant documents in Weaviate.\n",
    "    - Generating a final answer using an LLM augmented with the retrieved documents.\n",
    "6.  **Cleanup**: Removing the Docker container to free up system resources."
